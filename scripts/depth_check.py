"""Enforce the plan's Part 11 depth contract on a day folder.

A day is written when it is a hub plus one document per subtopic (Principle 16), each taken from
zero prior knowledge through to production (Principle 18), with no clock anywhere (Principle 17).
This script is the machine-readable half of that contract: it cannot judge whether an explanation
is good, but it can refuse a day that has no parts, a numbering gap, a missing required section, a
code block nobody walked through, a time estimate, a dead cross-part link, a part loose outside its
section folder, a day or section folder whose name does not say what is inside it, or a hub that
quietly went back to teaching.

Since plan v2.2.0 it also refuses a part that does not say what kind of document it is and where its
idea came from (`kind:` and `paper:`), a paper document that is missing its citation, its runnable
demo or its account of what did not survive, and a part that cites a primary source its day never
teaches - because Principle 19 says a source is taught in a document of its own, in the day's
papers/ directory, not summarised in a box inside the part that uses it.

    uv run python scripts/depth_check.py          # every day that has a parts/ directory
    uv run python scripts/depth_check.py 4        # just day 4
    uv run python scripts/depth_check.py 4 5 6    # several days

Exit code 0 means every checked day satisfies the contract. Anything else is a failure list.
